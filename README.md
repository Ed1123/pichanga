This app was originally a project for a Udacity course. I did it without noticing that submitting the project was an option just for people enrolled in the nanodegree program (the payed version of the course). I realized it when I clicked the submit button. It was a little bit frustrating because it's kind of my first android app and it took its time, BUT it give me the energy to learn about GitHub, how to use the platform aaaaaaaand I'm here posting my app. ^^

I'm using a Moto G3 with Android 7.1.2 and API 25 (it seems to be useful information according the course).

There's a little bit of background needed to understand the functionality of my app. I usually go to play "pichangas" with my friends. It's a kind of street soccer common in Peru (I don't know if it is called the same way in other countries). In those sessions we are 2 teams playing against each other for about 2 hours, from 3 to 6, or even more, matches. My app keeps track of the goals for a match and the number of matches won for each team. It also has a Draw button when a match ends with same scores. The app is helpful for us to know at the end of the session which team have to pay for the soda (or water for me ^^).
